     <h1>When I think <br>of her <br>sparkling face</h2>
        <h6>And of her body that rocked </h6><h2>this way <br>and that,
         </h2><p>When I think <br>of her <br> laughter,
        </p>
        
        <h6>Her jubilance <br>that filled me,</h6><p>
It’s a wonder <br>I’m not gone mad.
        </p>
        <p>She is away <br>and I cannot do <br>what I want.</p><p>Other faces pale <br>when I get close.</p>
        
        <h1>She is away <br> and I cannot <br><em>breathe</em> her in.
        </h1>
        <p>The space her <br> leaving has created<br>I have attempted to fill</p>
        
        <p>With bodies <br>that numbed <br>upon touching,</p><p>Among them <br>I expected <br>her opposite,<br>And found <br>only forgeries.
        </p>
        
        <p>Her wholeness<br> I know to be <br>a fiction of <br>my making,<br>
            </p><p>Still I cannot dismiss <br>the longing for her;</p>
        <p>It is a craving <br>for sensation <br>new <em>flesh</em></p><p><em>Cannot</em> wholly <br>calm or cancel,<br>
</p><p>It is perhaps <br>for more than her.
        </p>
        <p>
            At night above <br>the parks  the stars <br>are swarming.</p><p>
The streets are <br>thick with nostalgia;</p><p>
I move through <br>senseless routine <br> and insensitive chatter</p><p> As if her going <br>did not matter.</p>
        <p>She is away <br>and I cannot <br>breathe her in.</p><p>
        I am <br><strong>ill</strong> simply <br>through <br>wanting her.
