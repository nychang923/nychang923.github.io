        <h3>When I think <br>of her
        sparkling face</h3>
        <p>And of her <br> body that <br>rocked <br>this way <br>and that,
        </p><h3>When I think <br>of her laughter,</h3>
        
        
        <p>Her jubilance <br>that filled me,<br>
It’s a wonder <br>I’m not gone mad.
        </p>
        
        <h3>She is away </h3>
        <p>and I cannot do <br>what I want.<br>Other faces pale <br>when I get close.</p>
        
        <h3>She is away </h3>
        <p> and I cannot <br>breathe her in.
        </p>
        <p><em>The space her <br> leaving has created<br>I have attempted to fill</em></p>
        
        <p>With bodies <br>that numbed <br>upon touching,</p>
        
        <p><em>Among them <br>I expected her opposite,<br>And found only forgeries.</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>Her wholeness<br> I know to be a fiction <br>of my making,</p>
        <p><em>
            Still I cannot dismiss <br>the longing for her;</em></p>
        <h4>It is a craving <br>for sensation <br>new flesh<br>
<br>Cannot wholly <br>calm or cancel,<br>
It is perhaps <br>for more than her.
        </p>
        <p>
            At night above <br>the parks <br> the stars <br>are swarming.</p><p>
The streets are <br>thick with nostalgia;<br>
I move through <br>senseless routine <br> and insensitive chatter<br> As if her going <br>did not matter.</p>
        <h2>She is away <br>and I cannot <br>breathe her in.<br>
I am ill <br>simply through <br>wanting her.
