     <p>When I think of her <br>sparkling face
<br>And of her <br> body that rocked this way and that,<br>
When I think of her <br> laughter,<br>
Her jubilance that filled me,<br>
It’s a wonder I’m not gone mad.
        </p>
        <p>
She is away and I cannot do what I want.<br>
Other faces pale when I get close.<br>
She is away <br> and I cannot breathe her in.
        </p>
        <p>
The space her <br> leaving has created<br>
I have attempted to fill<br>
With bodies that numbed upon touching,<br>
Among them I expected her opposite,<br>
And found only forgeries.
        </p>
        <p>
Her wholeness<br> I know to be a fiction of my making,<br>
Still I cannot dismiss the longing for her;<br>
It is a craving for sensation new flesh<br>
Cannot wholly calm or cancel,<br>
It is perhaps for more than her.
        </p>
        <p>
            At night above the parks <br> the stars are swarming.<br>
The streets are thick with nostalgia;<br>
I move through senseless routine <br> and insensitive chatter<br> As if her going did not matter.<br>
            She is away <br> and I cannot breathe her in.</p><p>
I am ill simply through wanting her.
