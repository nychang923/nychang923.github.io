        <div><h1>When</h1> I think of her <strong>sparkling</strong> face
            <br>And of her <em>body</em> that rocked this way and that,<br>
When I think of her laughter,<br>
            Her <em>jubilance</em> that filled me,<br>
It’s a wonder I’m not gone mad.
       
        </div>
        <div>
She is away and I cannot do what I want.<br>
Other faces pale when I get close.<br>
She is away and I cannot breathe her in.
       
        </div>
        <p style="color:purple">
The <strong>space</strong> her leaving has created<br>
I have attempted to fill With bodies that numbed upon touching,
Among them I expected her opposite,<br>
And found only forgeries.
        </p>
        <div>
Her <strong>wholeness</strong> I know to be a fiction of my making,<br>
Still I cannot dismiss the longing for her;<br>
It is a craving for sensation new flesh<br>
Cannot wholly calm or cancel,<br>
It is perhaps for more than her.
        </div>
        <p style="color:blue">
            At <strong>night</strong> above the parks the stars are swarming.<br>
            The streets are thick with <em>nostalgia</em>;<br>
            I move through senseless routine and<br> <em>insensitive chatter</em>&nbsp;<br></p><br>
        <div>As if her going did not matter.<br>
She is away and I cannot breathe her in.<br>
I am ill simply through <strong>wanting</strong> her.
        </div>
