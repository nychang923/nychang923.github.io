            When I think of <h1>HER</h1> sparkling face<br>And of her body that rocked this way and that,<br>When I think of her laughter,<br>Her jubilance that filled me,<br>It’s a wonder I’m not gone mad.
        </div>
    
        <p>She is away and I cannot do what I want.<br>Other faces pale when I get close.<br>She is away and I cannot breathe her in.</p>
       
        <div style="color:#0000FF">The space her leaving has created<br>I have attempted to fill<br>With bodies that numbed upon touching,<br>Among them I expected her opposite,<br>And found only forgeries.
        </div>
    
        <p>Her wholeness I know to be a fiction of my making,<br>
Still I cannot dismiss the longing for her;<br>It is a craving for sensation new flesh<br>Cannot wholly calm or cancel,<br>It is perhaps for more than her.</p>

        <div style="color:#0000FF">
            At night above the parks the stars are swarming.<br>The streets are thick with nostalgia;<br>I move through senseless routine and<br> insensitive chatter&nbsp;As if her going did not matter.<br>She is away and I cannot breathe her in.<br>I am ill simply through wanting her.
