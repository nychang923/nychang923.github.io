        <h1>When <br>I <strong><em>think</em></strong> of her <br>sparkling face</h1><h2>
And of her <br> body that rocked <br>this way and that,<br>
When I think <br>of her laughter,
        </h2>
        
        <h3>Her jubilance <br>that <em>filled</em> me,<br>
It’s a wonder <br>I’m not gone mad.
        </h3>
        <h4>
            She is <em>away</em> <br>and I cannot do <br>what I want.<br>
            Other faces pale <br>when I get <em>close</em>.

        </h4><p style="color:red"><em>She is away <br> and I cannot <br>breathe her in.
        </em></p>
        <p style="color:yellow">
The space her <br> leaving has created<br>
I have attempted to fill<br>
With bodies that numbed <br>upon touching,<br>
Among them I expected <br>her opposite,<br>
And found only forgeries.
        </p>
        <p style="color:green">
Her wholeness<br> I know to be <br>a fiction of my making,<br>
Still I cannot dismiss <br>the longing for her;<br>
It is a craving for sensation <br>new flesh<br>
Cannot wholly calm or cancel,<br>
It is perhaps <br>for more than her.
        </p>
        <p style="color:blue">
            At night above the parks <br> the stars are swarming.<br>
The streets are <br>thick with nostalgia;<br>
I move through <br>senseless routine <br> and insensitive chatter<br> As if her going <br>did not matter.
        </p><h5>She is away and I cannot breathe her in.<br>
        I am ill simply through wanting her.</h5>
