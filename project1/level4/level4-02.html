        <p>When I think of <em>her</em> <br>sparkling face
<br>And of her <br> body that rocked this way and that,<br>
            When I think of <em>her</em> <br> laughter,<br>
            <em>Her</em> jubilance that filled me,<br>
It’s a wonder I’m not gone mad.
        </p>
        <p>
She is away and I cannot do what I want.<br>
Other faces pale when I get close.<br>
            She is away <br> and I cannot breathe <em>her</em> in.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The space <em>her</em> leaving has created<br>
I have attempted to fill with <br>bodies that numbed upon touching,<br>
            Among them I expected <em>her</em> opposite,<br>
And found only forgeries.
        </h2>
        <p>
            <em>Her</em> wholeness<br> I know to be a fiction of my making,<br>
Still I cannot dismiss the longing for her;<br>
It is a craving for sensation new flesh<br>
Cannot wholly calm or cancel,<br>
            It is perhaps for more than <em>her</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            At night above the parks <br> the stars are swarming.<br>
The streets are thick with nostalgia;<br>
            I move through senseless routine <br> and insensitive chatter<br> As if <em>her</em> going did not matter.<br>
            She is away <br> and I cannot breathe <em>her</em> in.</p><h6>
        I am ill simply through wanting <em>her</em>.
        </h6>
